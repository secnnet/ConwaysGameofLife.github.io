# Conway's Game of Life

This repository contains a simple yet interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's written using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features:

Game board visualization.
Controls to start, pause, reset, and step through the game.
Ability to adjust game speed.
Ability to adjust grid size.
A gradient color scheme for live cells.
Responsive design.

## How to Run:

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/secnnet/Conways-Game-of-Life.git.
Open the index.html file in your web browser. Or visit https://secnnet.github.io/ConwaysGameofLife.github.io/ 

## How to Use:

Start: Click on the 'Start' button to start the simulation.
Pause: Click on the 'Pause' button to pause the simulation.
Reset: Click on the 'Reset' button to clear the grid and stop the simulation.
Step: Click on the 'Step' button to advance the simulation by one generation.
Speed: Adjust the speed of the simulation using the 'Speed' slider.
Grid Size: Adjust the size of the grid using the 'Grid Size' slider.
Canvas: Click on any cell in the canvas to toggle its state between alive (colored) and dead (white).
